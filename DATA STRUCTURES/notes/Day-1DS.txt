Algorithms-and-data Structures

Course Objective:

The fundamental study, analysis and implementation of basic data structures & algorithms
for the development of Realtime practical application.

Data Structures:
Collecting and organizing of data is called data structure.
2 types:
1)Linear Data Structures
2) Non-Linear Data Structures

1)Linear Data Structures
Linear Data Structures are a type of data structure in computer science where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element has a previous and next adjacent, except for the first and last elements.
Characteristics of Linear Data Structure:
a)Sequential Organization
b) Order Preservation
c) Fixed or Dynamic Size
d) Efficient Access
1) Linear Data Structures
Arrays
Stacks
Queues
LinkedList

2)Non-Linear Data Structures
Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. 

In a non-linear data structure.
Trees and Graphs

Non-Sequential Organization
Data elements are not arranged sequentially; they are connected in a hierarchical or network-like structure.
Dynamic Memory Utilization
Non-linear structures often use pointers or references, enabling efficient use of memory for dynamic data representation.
Non-Fixed Size

CO-1
Algorithm Analysis
Asymptotic Notations
Sorting Techniques


Algorithm:

Characteristics of an Algorithm;
1)Input
zero (or) more wee defined i/ps
2) Output
should have at least one o/p
3) Unambiguous/Definiteness
Every statement must have single meaning
   Read a
   Read b
4)Finiteness
Steps must be countable while(1)
                        {
                         printf("hello");
                         }
5)Effectiveness
at last we will get ultimate output 

how to write an algorithm

sum of 2 nos
step 1: Start/begin
step 2: Read a,b   input/enter
step 3: sum=a+b
step 4: print sum
step 5: stop/end


Greatest among 3 nos
step 1: start
step 2: Read a,b,c
step 3: if a>b then goto step 4
         otherwise goto step 5
step 4: if a>c then
        print a is largest otherwise
        print c is largest
step 5: if b>c then
        print b is largest otherwise
        print c is largest
step 6: stop


Write an algorithm &  flow chart to read a number and
check whether it is +ve or -ve
step 1: start
step 2: read number n
step 3: if(n>0)
     3.1:print number is +ve
step 4: else
     4.1 : print number is -ve

step 5: stop
To check whether the given number is positive /negative or zero


step 1: Start
step 2: Read n
step 3: if(n>0)
     3.1: print it is +ve
step 4: else if(n<0)
      4.1: print it is "-ve"
step 5: else
        print it is equal to "0"
step 6: stop


 
Analysis of an Algorithm

In order to evaluate Algorithm we need 2 factors
1) Time Complexity
2) Space Complexity

1) Time Complexity
The amount of time required to compile and execute the program is called time
complexity



2) Space Complexity
The amount of space occupied by the program is called as space complexity.
