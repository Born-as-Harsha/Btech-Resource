Analysis of an Algorithm

In order to evaluate Algorithm we need 2 factors
1) Time Complexity
2) Space Complexity

1) Time Complexity
The amount of time required to compile and execute the program is called time
complexity



2) Space Complexity
The amount of space occupied by the program is called as space complexity.


Steps to Calculate Time Complexity
1) Identify no.of Blocks
    a) Declaration -1 Block      
    b) Initialization- 1 Block
       a and b Time complexity will be constant O(1)
    c) Iterations- 1 Block
         dependent
         Independent

       (nested loops) multiplication of Nested loops
    d) Conditional Statemnets-1 Block
       If its a conditional we have to consider only one case
         max(if,else) 
          select max time complexity
2) Avoid Constants 
     2n ,n/2,n+1
3) Add time complexity of all blocks
4) Finally the time complexity will be higher order in equation

    Ex:1 for(i=0;i<=n;i++)   n+1 times
         {
          --------
          }

Time Complexity of the above code is O(n)
the  worst case  time complexity is always representing  O(n) in upper bound
  ex: 2
       for(i=1;i<=n;i=i*2)
{
===
==                           

}

                      2pow k <=n
                     k=log n
                          2
time complexity= O(log n)
		      2

ex: 3
for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
{
for(j=0;j<=n;j++)
{
for(k=0;k<=n;k++)
{
---
}
---
}
---
}
time complexity=O(n)

Analyze the time complexity of the following Algorithms.
1)
Start
Read a,b   1
c=a+b      1
print c    1
stop
f(n)=3

2) Start
   Read n
   i=1
   while(i<=n/2)
   print i
   i++    
   stop
  f(n)=1+1+n/2+1+n/2+n/2
      =3(n/2)+3
      =(n/2)+1
      =log(n/2)+1
      =1/2(logn)+1
      =logn
3) start
   read n        1
   for i=1 to n  n+1
   sum=sum+i     n
   print sum     1
   stop 
4) start
   read            1
   for i=1 to n   n+1
   for j=1 to n   n+1
   print *         n(n)
   stop
5)start
  read n             1
  for i=1 to n       n+1
  for j=1 to n/2     (n/2+1)n
  sum=sum+a[i][j]    n(n/2)
  print sum          1
  stop

Asymptotic Notations
 mathematical representation of time complexity we use notations.
In order to find the time complexity of an algorithm we use asymptotic notations.
there are 3 types
1) Big-O(worst case)--O(n)
2) Omega(best case)---O(1)
3) Theta( Avg case)---O(logn)

1) Big-O
  It gives you the upper bound of an algorithm that is worst case time complexity of an algorithm
  It is expressed as
  lef f(n) and g(n) are two functions such that f(n)=O(g(n))
  if there exists a constant c,if and only if f(n)<=c.g(n)for all n>=no

2) Omega-
It gives lower bound of an  algorithm that is it gives the best case time complexity of an algorithm.
Mathematically it is expressed as let f(n) and g(n) are two functions
such that f(n)=Omega(g(n)).If there exists a constant c if and only if f(n)>=c.g(n)
for all n>=n0
3) Theta
It gives the average case time complexity of an algorithm. Mathematically it is expressed
as let f(n) and g(n) are two functions.
such that f(n)=theta(g(n)) if there exists a constant c1 and c2,if and only if
c1.g(n)<=f(n)<=c2.g(n) for all n>=n0.

calculate the time complexity for the following algorithm
(wort case-Big O notation)
start
read
sum=0
for i=1 to n
sum=sum+i
print sum
stop

f(n)=2n+4
f(n)<=c.g(n)
2n+4<=2n+4n
2n+4<=6n
put n=1
2+4<=6
put n=2
8<=12
f(n)<=6n
f(n)<=c.g(n)
c-constant
g(n)=n
g(n)=O(n)


2)calculate the time complexity of the given function 
f(n)=3n^2+3n+4
  f(n)<=c.g(n)
3n^2+3n+4<=3n^2+3n^2+4n^2
3n^2+3n+4<=10n^2
f(n)<=c.g(n)
n=1

O(n^2)

3) calculate the time complexity of the given function
 best case
start       0
read n      1
sum=0       1
for i=1 to n  n+1
sum=sum+i     n
print sum     1
stop

   f(n)=2n+4
    f(n)=omega(g(n))
     f(n)>=c.g(n)
     2n+4>=2n
     put n=1
     put n=2
     f(n)>=c.g(n)

      g(n)=n
     omega(n)

4) calculate the time complexity of the given function best case
   f(n)=3n^2+3n+2
   f(n)>=c.g(n)
   3n^2+3n+2>=3n^2
   put n=1
omega(n^2)
5) Theta average case

c1.g(n)<=f(n)<=c2.g(n)
f(n)=2n+4
c1.g(n)<=2n+4<=c2.g(n)
2n<+2n+4<=6n
c1.g(n)     c2.g(n)
wort        best
best case time complexity is the answer for this solution
